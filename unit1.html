	   <p>The Internet is a global wide area network that connects computer systems across the world.INTERNET stands for Interconnected Network is a network system that connects millions of web servers.It includes several high-bandwidth data lines that comprise the Internet "backbone."These lines are connected to major Internet hubs that distribute data to other locations, such as web servers and ISPs.In order to connect to the Internet, you must have access to an Internet service provider (ISP), which acts the middleman between you and the Internet. Most ISPs offer broadband Internet access via a cable, DSL, or fiber connection. When you connect to the Internet using a public Wi-Fi signal, the Wi-Fi router is still connected to an ISP that provides Internet access.When you visit a website, your computer sends a request over these wires to a server. A server is where websites are stored, and it works a lot like your computer's hard drive. Once the request arrives, the server retrieves the website and sends the correct data back to.sssss

		<p>1.This internet is implemented or evolved from ARPANET or Advanced Research Project Agency Network in the year of 1969. Originally funded by the U.S Department of Defense.<br/>
			2.ARPANET adopted TCP/IP on January 1, 1983, and from there researchers began to assemble the “network of networks” that became the modern Internet.<br/>
			3.The online world then took on a more recognizable form in 1989, when computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web,January 1, 1983 is considered the official birthday of the Internet.<br/>
			4.In the year 1995,Amazon and Ebay were introduced.<br/>
			5.In the year 1996,Internet explorer and Landscape were introduced.<br/>
			6.In the year 1998,the Google Search Engine started.<br/>
			7.A total of <mark>5.07</mark> billion people around the world use the internet today.<br/>
			8.China as the most no of Internet users.India is in 2nd palce.

      <h2 id="j" style="color:red">What are the basic services provided by the Internet?</h2>
      <p>
       1.Communication Services like Instant Messaging,Email,Video Conferencing.<br/>
       2.Information Retrieval Services:<br/>
       &emsp;It allows users to access remote computers and transfer files from one machine to another.It contains two protocols such as FTP(File Transfer Protocol) and SFTP(Simple File Transfer Protocol).<br/>
       &emsp;&emsp;FTP:It is an internet utility software which is used for uploading and downloading files.FTP enables access to remote computer folders and allows files and folders to be transferred between different computers.<br/>
       &emsp;&emsp;SFTP:SFTP stands for SSH File Transfer Protocol. Sometimes it is called Secure File Transfer Protocol. It is more secure than FTP. It supports the complete SSH protocol protection and authentication feature, including the &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;SSH key.<br/>
       3.Directory Services:<br/>
       &emsp;&emsp;DNS(Domain Name Service):The task of the DNS is to translate human-readable domain names like ourtechroom.com into IP addresses(something like 192.168.10.12) so that the web browser can load the requested resources &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;from the server.<br/>
       &emsp;&emsp;LDAP(Lightweight Directory Access Protocol):If your data do not change frequently then you can store your data in LDAP Services and you can access it frequently as LDAP &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;provides a ' write-once-read-multiple-times' service.<br/>
       4.Network Management Services:Network management services are also one of the important services of the internet which are helpful for network managers.<br/>
       5.Ecommerce:E-commerce is Internet-based buying and sale of goods and services. Today, almost anything that is available in the market can be purchased through e-commerce.<br/>
       6.<span style="color:red;">WWW(World Wide Web):</span>Most of us think that the Internet and WWW are the same but actually not. Internet is Infrastructure and the Web is just a service provided on the Internet. Internet is a network of networks and Web is &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;just information present in the network.<br/>
       &emsp;&emsp;a)World Wide Web, which is also known as a Web, is a collection of websites or web pages stored in web servers and connected to local computers through the internet.<br/>
       &emsp;&emsp;b)The World Wide Web was invented by a British scientist, Tim Berners-Lee in 1989. He was working at CERN at that time. Originally, it was developed by him to fulfill the need of automated information sharing between &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;scientists across the world, so that they could easily share the data,results of their experiments and studies with each other.<br/>
       &emsp;&emsp;c)Tim focused on three main technologies that could make computers understand each other, HTML, URL, and HTTP. So, the objective behind the invention of WWW was to combine recent computer technologies, data &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;networks,and hypertext into a user-friendly and effective global information system.<br/>
       &emsp;&emsp;d)These websites contain text pages, digital images, audios, videos, etc. Users can access the content of these sites from any part of the world over the internet using their devices such as computers, laptops, cell phones, etc.<br/>
       &emsp;&emsp;e)The building blocks of the Web are web pages which are formatted in HTML and connected by links called "hypertext" or hyperlinks and accessed by HTTP. These links are electronic connections that link related &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;information so that users can access the desired information quickly.<br/>
       &emsp;&emsp;f)A web page is given an online address called a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). A particular collection of web pages that belong to a specific URL is called a website. The URL consists of two parts : protocol and resource &emsp;&emsp;name.<br/>

      <h2 id="k" style="color:red">Types of Computer Applications?</h2>
      <p>There are some different types of computer applications.They are:-</p>
      <p>1.Console Applications.<br>2.Window Applicatons.<br>3.Embedded systems.<br>4.Web Applications.<br>
         5.Mobile Web Applications.<br>6.Cloud Web Applications.

      <h2 id="k" style="color:red;">About Client-Server Process and how it works?</h2>
      <p>Client: When we talk the word Client, it mean to talk of a person or an organization using a particular service. Similarly in the digital world a Client is a computer (Host) i.e. capable of receiving information or using a particular service from the service providers (Servers).</p>
      <p>Servers: Similarly, when we talk the word Servers, It mean a person or medium that serves something. Similarly in this digital world a Server is a remote computer which provides information (data) or access to particular services.</p>
      <p>So, its basically the Client requesting something and the Server serving it as long as its present in the database.</p>

      <h2 id="l" style="color:orangered;">Introduction To HTML:</h2>
    	  1)HTML stands for <span style="color:green;">Hyper Text Markup Language.</span><br/>
    	  2)HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. HTML describes the structure of a Web page. HTML consists of a series of elements. HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.<br/>
    	<h3 style="color: orangered;">History:</h3>
    	1)HTML was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991 but was not officially released.<br/>
    	2)HTML 1.0 was released in 1993 with the intention of sharing information that can be readable and accessible via web browsers. But not many of the developers were involved in creating websites. So the language was also not growing.<br/>
    	3)Then comes HTML 2.0, published in 1995, which contains all the features of HTML 1.0 along with a few additional features, which remained the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until January 1997 and refined various core features of HTML.<br/>
    	4)Then comes HTML 3.0, where Dave Raggett introduced a fresh paper or draft on HTML. It included improved new features of HTML, giving more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing web pages. But these powerful features of the new HTML slowed down the browser in applying further improvements.<br/>
    	5)Then comes HTML 4.01, which is widely used and was a successful version of HTML before HTML 5.0, which is currently released and used worldwide. HTML 5 can be said for an extended version of HTML 4.01, which was published in the year 2012.<br/>
    	6)HTML 5 introduced so many semantic tags and input types.

      </p>
    	<p>1)In the above structure,the &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt; are HTML Tags and inbetween (h2 and p) are HTML Elements.<br/>
    		2)HTML tags are used to hold the HTML element.<br/>
    		3)For every HTML Tag there is an Opening(&lt;p&gt;) and Closing Tag(&lt;/p&gt;).<br/>
    		4)HTML Element holds the Content.<br/>
    		5)HTML attributes are used to describe the characteristic of an HTML element in detail.<br/>
    		6)class is an HTML attribute and it as value.
